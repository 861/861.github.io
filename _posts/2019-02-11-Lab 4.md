# Discussion
1. You learned three different ways to visualize temporal data. Add a text box to discuss their pros
and cons (again, think about your purpose of communication and your audience). (5 points)

    Dual-axis Line Chart Pros: Compared to the traditional line chart, the dual-axis line chart could make full use of the canvas and dual-axis line chart could easily display the differences between two types of data.
    Dual-axis Line Chart Cons: Users must have to observe the chart axes carefully and tell the difference between the two axes.

    Connected Scatterplot Pros: Users may discover the potential pattern of the data.

    Connected Scatterplot Cons: Some parts of the chart may look cluttered because the connection between several points and users may not very clear about the order of data.

    Timeline Gantt Chart Pros: The bar size of the Timeline Gantt Chart could easily indicate the amount and the portion of subset data. The subset temporal data could also overlay on the other temporal. We can easily make the comparison to the temporal data.
    
    Timeline Gantt Chart Cons: They are extraordinarily complex. We can only display the data by using the bars and different colors, but we can not know the exact data.
