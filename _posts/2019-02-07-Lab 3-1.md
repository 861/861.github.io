# Discussion

1. Based on Tasks 1-2, compare the effectiveness of scatterplot and quadrant chart in communicating the information of interest

    Compared to scatterplot, the quadrant chart can communicate the information more effectively in some cases. Because the quadrant chart divides the scatterplot into four parts based on the average. For example, in task 2, the figure is divided based on whether they scored an above or below average number of goals, and whether they took an above or below average number of shots in their careers. Thus, we can easily choose the few number of players in the top-left quadrant due to fewer shots with higher goals. However, scatterplot also has its advantages. If we just want to explore the correlation between variables, scatterplot would be much easier. And scatterplot is also a good tool to find outliers.
